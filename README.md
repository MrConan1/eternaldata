# About this project

This project contains my notes on the file formats used by [Lunar 2: Eternal Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar:_Eternal_Blue), the 32-bit remake of [Studio Alex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Alex)/[Game Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Arts)'s Sega CD game Lunar: Eternal Blue.

For notes on the first Saturn Lunar game, [see this repository](https://github.com/mistydemeo/lunardata).
